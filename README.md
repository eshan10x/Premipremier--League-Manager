For this project i have used Java for the back-end and AngularJs for the front-end. Also play frame work has used.
This program can maintain list of football clubs and shedule matched between two teams. also in GUI we can get the list of clubs and create random matched between two clubs and different sorting options.

To create this project we need to have,

* Java 1.8 build (need to switch between multiple java version?)
* sbt latest - https://www.scala-sbt.org/index.html
* IDE (Prefer Intellij) - https://www.jetbrains.com/idea
* IDE plugins - scala and play

If youâ€™re on macOS,
You need to have homebrew installed and if you recently updated to
macOS Big Sur with homebrew you need to reinstall terminal tools.
